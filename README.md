# Random_Forest

# Project Title :
                  
 Classify the Random forest algorithm using sciket learn classfier "RandomForestClassfier" for "Iris.csv",and Predict the data how many species are inter connect with Nth Decision Tree node.

 # TASK :

1. Import RandomForestClassfier by using sklearn.ensemble library.

2. Load the data using seaborn graphics library as a argument Load_Iris()

3. Preprocess the data unsig sckitlearn graphics library

4. Select the model using "Model_selection" from sls as seaborn and sk learn as a sciket learn machine learning library

5. Load_Iris.csv dataset for data as a input variable and target as a functional output variable

6. Pick the train and test data using argumented library train_test_split 

7. select the estimators as a Nth Decision Tree 

8. Use a random forest classfier  and fit ur model

9. Find out the model accuracy
